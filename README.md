# From Denoising to Scores: DAEs to Noise-Conditional Score Networks

This project implements and validates the theoretical connection between **Denoising Autoencoders (DAE)** and **Noise-Conditional Score Networks (NCSN)**, demonstrating how multi-scale score estimation enables stable, high-quality generative modeling.

The primary focus is verifying the necessity of **Annealed Langevin Dynamics** to overcome the mixing failures of single-scale score matching.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into distinct, clean directories for easy navigation:

| Directory | Purpose | Key Files |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `src/` | **Source Code.** Contains all core Python modules. | `models_mnist.py`, `sampling.py` (Langevin implementations) |
| `scripts/` | **Execution Scripts.** Files used to run specific experiments. | `run_ablation.py`, `run_inpainting.py` |
| `results/` | **Generated Outputs.** Stores all plots and figures generated by the scripts. | `ablation/`, `mixing/`, `inpainting/` |
| `docs/` | **Final Deliverables.** Contains the final report and poster assets. | `report/`, `poster/` |
| `data/` | **Dataset Files.** Local storage for the MNIST dataset. | MNIST raw files |
| `assets/` | **Reference Papers.** Key literature used in the project. | `Song2019.pdf`, `Vincent.pdf` |


## Running Experiments

All execution scripts are located in the `scripts/` folder. Run them using the `-m` flag from the root directory to handle module imports correctly.

| Experiment | Goal | Command |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ablation Study** | Verify $L=1$ failure and $L=50$ fragility. | `python -m scripts.run_ablation` |
| **Mixing Comparison** | Visualize how annealing fixes mode collapse. | `python -m scripts.run_bridge_exp` |
| **Inpainting** | Demonstrate conditional generative capacity. | `python -m scripts.run_inpainting` |

The generated images will be saved automatically into the corresponding `results/` subfolders (e.g., `results/ablation/`).
